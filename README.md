# Dependencies
>libpng++-dev

# How to Build
execute build.sh on Linux via:

>
> "input_file" is the sample png image
>
> "sample_size" is the size of neighborhood reads
>
> "sample_count" is the number of neighborhoods sampled from the source image
>
> "width" and "height" are the output dimensions
